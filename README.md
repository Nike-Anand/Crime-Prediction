By leveraging historical data and advanced algorithms, the system provides predictions for overall crime rates and specific crime categories for a given district and year. Additionally, the project features dynamic visualizations that display crime trends up to the specified year.

## Key Features
- **District and Year-Based Predictions**: Input a district and a year to predict overall crime rates and individual crime categories.
- **Dynamic Graph Visualization**: Display historical and predicted crime trends in a user-friendly graph.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simplified input system for easy use by non-technical users.
